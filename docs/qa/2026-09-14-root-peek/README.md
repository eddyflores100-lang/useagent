# Root conversation peek semantics

## Live reproduction

Reload All threads, find the QA controls-only root conversation, and choose Peek run. The deployed pane calls the root a Subagent and offers Pass instructions down. The before and after screenshots live on pull request #349.

Ordinary replies also have `parent_run_id`; that field does not prove that a run is a gateway child. The authoritative discriminator is decoded `child_session === true`.

## Fix and checks

- Root runs and ordinary replies show Session and Open thread, not child-only controls.
- Real gateway children retain Subagent and the pass-down composer.
- Unknown code-split loading is neutral Run; caller-known loading/error metadata remains supported.
- Fetched run data, not a caller hint, controls available child actions.
- Six rendering/selection tests pass; pinned TypeScript 5.9 full-root check, targeted lint, full frontend lint and production build pass. The existing route-chunks filesystem tracing warning remains unchanged.
- Independent code review APPROVE and architecture CLEAR. Post-review cleanup shares the identical footer wrapper and introduces no behavior change or dependency.

The after screenshots on the pull request show the patched LoadedPane component rendered with production CSS and synthetic root/child data in Chrome. The isolated fixture uses a fallback font and no hydration/backend. They prove the visual classification and control split, not a deployed navigation or pass-down test.

## Bundle measurement

Compared separate production builds of unchanged frontend commit `6a43a9f53` and this patch using the repository's manifest/rootMainFiles aggregation and gzip sizing:

| Route | Before gzip bytes | After gzip bytes | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| /agent/runs | 448,733 | 448,812 | +79 |
| /session/[id] | 629,821 | 629,900 | +79 |
| /bots | 661,303 | 661,382 | +79 |

All measured routes increased by 79 bytes in these builds; the largest remains below the documented 660 KiB ceiling. The rounded runs-page measurement stays 438 KiB, but this is not a zero-byte-growth claim. No source/data fetching or stream behavior was changed.

No merge, deployment, credentials, or existing user files were changed by this audit. CI remains the final repository-wide gate.
