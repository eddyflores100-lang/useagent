// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Durable run cancellation (north star "Durable Commands"). A user Stop enters
// through a `run.cancel` command — the durable, idempotent record of the intent
// — exactly like `run.create`. The command is written already-`completed`
// (its action is a one-shot signal, not a queued turn), so a crash can NEVER
// leave a cancel command stuck in the mailbox.
//
// The actual stop is split by the run's state at accept time, both handled here
// atomically or by the caller:
//   - QUEUED: the run never started, so we fail it AND settle its `run.create`
//     command IN THE SAME TRANSACTION — the boot reconciler can then never
//     re-dispatch a cancelled turn.
//   - RUNNING: an actor is live in this process; the caller signals its
//     AbortController (worker.signalCancel), whose teardown finalizes the run
//     "Stopped by user" and pumps the thread. If the process died first, the
//     existing run.create recovery fails the orphaned run on boot.
