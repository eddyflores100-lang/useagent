/**
 * Declarative grants for the RESTRICTED sandbox-gateway role, applied
 * idempotently at every backend boot (right after migrations).
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE this exists to kill: grants used to live only in
 * the host provisioning script, which runs once at setup -
 * while tables arrive via migrations on every deploy. Twice a migration
 * shipped a gateway-written table whose INSERTs then died in production with
 * 42501 (knowledge_*, artifact_workpiece_proposals). With the manifest in
 * code, the grant lands in the same commit as the feature and every deploy
 * reconciles it. configure-host.sh owns only the empty-database-safe role and
 * REVOKE/default-privilege baseline. Migration 0039 owns the credentials view;
 * release migration and production boot apply this manifest after schema setup.
 *
 * Rules: least privilege, no DELETE anywhere, column-scoped where the lane
 * only touches specific columns. When a migration adds a table the GATEWAY
 * process writes, add it HERE in the same change.
